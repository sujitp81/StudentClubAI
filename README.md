Hello Everyone.

I am Sujit, I got my B.Tech in Computer Science from TKMCE in 2002. Our batch is called R98. Our batch donated our first AI Workstation. I currently work in Bioinformatics domain, working remotely from home. I hope to kickstart a small club/group at TKM.

During my last year at TKM, one of my seniors had a computer shop nearby, and I used to help out with computer assembly, it was fun. I did my Masters in Computer Science from TU/e in The Netherlands. There, I was part of several student groups, some technical, some for fun. Some groups had limited access to big server clusters and would try out new things. All the students in a batch would get the exact same model Laptop (mine was IBM T42), and all the student laptop troubleshooting/upgrading/maintanence were done by a student group.

Its been over a year since our batch donated the R98, during which I help arrange for other alumni and management machines, and its software configuration. I also helped several project teams with their technical issues. I have maybe 1-2 hrs of free time a week, and I can help with leading a club/group if there are enough interested students. Two weeks back I sent out a survey in the FOSS whatsapp group and I got 11 responses, which is more than enough to start a group. 



# Student Commputer/AI Club
- Minimum 1 hr work per week of "work/activity", 15min online/offline meeting per week.
- Tech Debts: Find and fix hardware and software technical challenges faced by students.
- Make a better dashboard for monitoring and allocating the AI servers.
- Try out new opensource AI models.
- Make all final-year-projects run with one command or click through VM or Docker.
- Mentor Junior students to take over the club.
- Other non AI activities

## Tech Debt
- Teamviewer free license over, using Anydesk free license, it sometimes gets blocked, need an alternative.
- KVM switch is not working with Anydesk, need to create a virtual mirrored display with opensource tools.

## Dashboard
- We currently use free account of newrelic.com to monitor our AI workstations, it cannot handle more machines unless we pay.
- The newrelic free account gives 24hr storage of data, we should write a script to poll it and cache it at TKM server and provide better usage metrics.

## Better server allocation
- Currently only one or two teams can use a worksation, we should explore options to allow queuing of training jobs using open software.

## Final year projects
- Club should take up ownership of the code of "selected" final year projects.
- All projects should be wrapped with docker or a VM, which should allow any student to try it out in an hour.

## Mentoring
- New blood, new ideas, hand over the torch, etc...

## Try out new AI models
- If any AI workstation is expected to be idle over the weekend or any break, we should as a group, try out new models from Hugging face. 

## Educational Game/Experiences
- Build educational 3D/VR games/experiences for school kids.

Anything to add/remove/tweak?
